# Logger for #100DaysOfCode
I have taken up the #100DaysOfCode which entails me to log my daily progress. To automate this cumbersome (not) task I have written a simple python script.

## What it does
* Keeps a track of number of days passed
* Creates log entry with today's date
* **Input:** Today's Progress, Thoughts and Link(s)

## Contents
* [logger.py](logger.py)
* [day.int](day.int) - Keeps track of days passed
